## Overview

The `stats-min` library allows you to compute the minimum value along one or more dimensions of an ndarray. This tool is essential for anyone working with numerical data, statistics, or mathematical computations in JavaScript.

### Features

- **Multi-dimensional Support**: Compute minimum values across multiple dimensions of ndarrays.
- **Fast Performance**: Optimized for speed, ensuring quick calculations even with large datasets.
- **Simple API**: Easy to use with a straightforward interface, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Installation

You can install `stats-min` via npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install stats-min
```

## Usage

To use `stats-min`, you first need to import it into your project. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```javascript
const statsMin = require('stats-min');

// Create an ndarray
const ndarray = require('ndarray');
const data = ndarray(new Float32Array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), [5]);

// Compute the minimum value
const minValue = statsMin(data);
console.log('Minimum Value:', minValue); // Outputs: Minimum Value: 1
```

### API

#### `statsMin(array, axis)`

- **array**: The input ndarray.
- **axis**: (Optional) The dimension along which to compute the minimum. If not specified, the minimum is computed over the entire array.

**Example**:

```javascript
const minValue = statsMin(data, 0);
console.log('Minimum Value along axis 0:', minValue);
```

## Topics Covered

This library is relevant to several topics in mathematics and statistics, including:

- **Domain**: The range of values that can be processed.
- **Extent**: The total number of dimensions in an ndarray.
- **Extremes**: Finding the minimum and maximum values in datasets.
- **Statistics**: Essential for data analysis and interpretation.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Minimum Calculation

```javascript
const ndarray = require('ndarray');
const statsMin = require('stats-min');

const data = ndarray(new Float32Array([10, 20, 30, 5, 15]), [5]);
const minValue = statsMin(data);
console.log('Minimum Value:', minValue); // Outputs: Minimum Value: 5
```

### Example 2: Minimum Calculation Along a Specific Axis

```javascript
const ndarray = require('ndarray');
const statsMin = require('stats-min');

const data = ndarray(new Float32Array([10, 20, 30, 5, 15, 25]), [2, 3]);
const minValueAxis0 = statsMin(data, 0);
console.log('Minimum Value along axis 0:', minValueAxis0); // Outputs: Minimum Value along axis 0: [5, 15, 25]
```

## Performance Benchmarking

To evaluate the performance of `stats-min`, we can compare it with other libraries. Below is a simple benchmark setup:

```javascript
const { performance } = require('perf_hooks');
const statsMin = require('stats-min');
const otherLibrary = require('other-library');

const data = ndarray(new Float32Array(1000000).fill(Math.random()), [1000, 1000]);

const startStatsMin = performance.now();
statsMin(data);
const endStatsMin = performance.now();

const startOtherLibrary = performance.now();
otherLibrary.min(data);
const endOtherLibrary = performance.now();

console.log(`stats-min: ${endStatsMin - startStatsMin} ms`);
console.log(`other-library: ${endOtherLibrary - startOtherLibrary} ms`);
```

## FAQ

### What is an ndarray?
